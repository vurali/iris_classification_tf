# Iris Classification with TensorFlow

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for classifying the Iris dataset using TensorFlow. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for educational purposes and benchmarking. This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a neural network model for classifying iris species.

## Project Overview

The notebook covers the following steps:
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load the Iris dataset and perform basic data exploration to understand its structure and properties.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the data for training by splitting it into training and testing sets, and standardizing feature values.
3. **Model Building**: Construct a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras.
4. **Model Training**: Train the model on the training data and monitor its performance.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model on the testing data to assess its accuracy and performance.
6. **Predictions**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```sh
pip install tensorflow keras pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/vurali/iris_classification_tf.git
   cd iris-classification-tf
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
     jupyter notebook Iris_Classification_tf.ipynb
    ```
3. Run the Notebook:
   Follow the steps in the notebook to execute the code cells. The notebook is organized sequentially, so start from the top and work your way down.

## Results
The notebook will output various results, including:

* **Visualizations of the data**: Graphs and charts that help in understanding the distribution and relationships within the dataset.
* **Training and validation accuracy and loss plots**: Plots that show how the model's accuracy and loss change over epochs during training and validation phases.
* **Model evaluation metrics**: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test set to evaluate the model's performance.
* **Sample predictions**: The model's predictions on new or test data along with the corresponding true labels to illustrate its performance.
